<p>You've come all this way. Hi.
</br>I'm Noémie.
</br>In my worklife, I'm the digital communications manager at la Gaîté lyrique - digital culture space in Paris, France.
</br>I still harbour a passion for words and books in general (English Lit major always), and so I also do some freelance translation, mostly in 
the cultural/academic fields. 
</br>I'm a knitter, I enjoy good tea, good food, good people.
</p>
